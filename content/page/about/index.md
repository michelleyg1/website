Hello! I'm Michelle,

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2021 with a Bachelors of Science in Public Health with no real specialization or idea about what I wanted to do with my degree. Shortly after, I found myself in the field of clinical research starting off working at a central imaging vendor providing support to various oncology clinical trials. 

Currently, I am working at an academic medical center providing administrative support for interventional clinical trials in both solid tumor and hematology disease groups.

In my free time I've decided to learn some statistical programming/data analysis skills as I am concurrently completing the math prerequisites to apply for an MS program in Biostatistics. I created this website to house my personal projects that I create to practice and reflect on the new skills that I've learned, and to satisfy my curiosity for research by analyzing publicly available data.

Outside of my career and education I enjoy working out, going to the Jersey shore, eating Peruvian food, and making cocktails.
