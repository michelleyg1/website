Hello! I'm Michelle,

I graduated from Rutgers University in 2021 with a Bachelors of Science in Public Health and I wasn't really too sure what I wanted to do with my degree. Shortly after, I found myself working in the field of oncology clinical research. 

Currently, I am working at an academic medical center providing administrative support for interventional clinical trials in both solid tumor and hematology disease groups.

In my free time I've decided to learn some statistical programming/data analysis skills as I am concurrently completing the math prerequisites to apply for an MS program in Biostatistics. I made this website to house my personal projects and reflect on what I've learned.

Outside of my career and education I enjoy working out, going to the Jersey shore, eating Peruvian food, and making cocktails.
