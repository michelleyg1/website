I found this [interesting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adampq/reported-asthma-incidents-by-state-2010-2020) on Kaggle and wanted to do an exploratory analysis as I also have had asthma since I was a kid and wanted to see if I could find any interesting patterns within the data.

## Load Packages
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(tidyverse)
    library(janitor)
})
```


## Import Dataset
```{r}
asthma <- read.csv("/Users/michellegulotta/Desktop/my_first_project/asthma/CDIAsthmaByStateTransposed2010-2020.csv")
asthma <- asthma %>% 
  janitor::clean_names(., "snake")
```

Taking a look at the first few rows of the data to see what kind of information this dataset is providing

```{r}
head(asthma)
```

## Asthma Fatalities by Gender in New Jersey Data Visualization
### Clean Up Data

Since its my home state, I decided to narrow the data that I wanted to look at down a bit to just New Jersey. I also only was interested in looking at fatalities for this particular graph as it is the most severe type of asthma incident recorded in this data.

The first thing that I needed to do was to pivot the data so that gender was its own observation, I originally missed out on this step when I was trying to make the graph and had a hard time coming up with the ggplot code as I was just repeating adding a different shape to my graph for each column. After a bit of trial and error I realized there was probably a way to do it where I wouldn’t have to add the columns individually as their own geoms.

```{r}
nj_asthma_fatalities <- asthma %>% 
  filter(state == "New Jersey") %>% 
  select(year, ends_with("_fatal")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_fatal"),
    names_to = "gender",
    values_to = "fatalities",
    names_pattern = "(.*)_fatal"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    gender = factor(gender, 
                    c("f", "m", "o"), 
                    c("Female", "Male", "Overall"))
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

### Create a Graph

Now to take my newly pivoted data and create a graph using the ggplot2 package:

```{r}
ggplot(data = nj_asthma_fatalities) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(
    x = year,
    y = fatalities, 
    group = gender, 
    color = gender), 
  se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("pink", "blue", "black")) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(title = "Asthma Fatalities in New Jersey by Gender from 2010 to 2020",
       x = "Years", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) +
  theme_bw()
```

This graph shows an interesting trend that at least in the state of New Jersey over the 2010s decade asthma fatality incidents increased and then decreased, just to increase once again around 2017. Also, another trend that caught my eye was that that females made up the majority of overall fatalities that were recorded.

As these are not proportional to the population, they do not tell us the whole story. I’m interested in seeing if the mortality rates show the same pattern as anyone living in New Jersey can tell you that the population has increased over this past decade just from the traffic alone, does the population change account for the increase in asthma fatality incidents?

### Calculate Mortality Rate per 100,000 People Column

I calculated the cause specific mortality rate per 100,000 people in the whole population of the state.

```{r}
nj_asthma_mortality_rate <- asthma %>% 
  filter(state == "New Jersey") %>% 
  select(year, pop_est, ends_with("_fatal")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_fatal"),
    names_to = "gender",
    values_to = "fatalities",
    names_pattern = "(.*)_fatal"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    gender = factor(gender, 
                    c("f", "m", "o"), 
                    c("Female", "Male", "Overall")),
    mortality_rate = round(((fatalities / pop_est) * 100000), 2)
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

### Create a Graph of Asthma Mortality Rate per 100,000 People and Group By Gender

Then I used ggplot2 to graph this new column to compare the mortality rate per 100,000 people over the decade of 2010 to 2020 to see if the same trend emerges:

```{r}
ggplot(data = nj_asthma_mortality_rate) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = year, 
                            y = mortality_rate, 
                            group = gender, 
                            color = gender), 
            se = FALSE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("pink", "blue", "black")) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(title = "Asthma Mortality Rate in New Jersey by Gender from 2010 to 2020", 
       x = "Years", 
       y = "Number of Fatalities") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5)) +
  theme_bw()
```

Interesting, the graphs look pretty much the same to me so the population increase is not the reason for the increase in asthma fatality incidents as the mortality rate from asthma follows the same pattern as the fatality incidents over time, as well as the gender disparity.

## Nationwide Analysis of Gender Differences In Asthma Mortality Rate
### Clean Up Data

```{r}
asthma_mortality <- asthma %>% 
  select(year, state, pop_est, f_fatal, m_fatal) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("_fatal"),
    names_to = "gender",
    values_to = "fatalities",
    names_pattern = "(.*)_fatal"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    gender = factor(gender, 
                    c("f", "m", "o"), 
                    c("Female", "Male", "Overall")),
    mortality_rate = round(((fatalities / pop_est) * 100000), 2)
      ) %>%
  filter(gender != "Overall") %>% 
  print()
```

I noticed there were a decent amount of missing values just by glancing at this lets see how many exactly

```{r}
sum(is.na(asthma_mortality$mortality_rate))
```

Hm, 264/1122 that is not that bad, also it does look like they're states with limited populations, so that might be the reason is that there just weren't any fatal asthma incidents in that particular year.

I'm going to remove the missing values for our next step in this analysis

```{r}
asthma_mortality_no_miss <- asthma_mortality %>% 
  drop_na(mortality_rate) %>% 
  print()
```


### Create a Histogram of Fatal Asthma Incidents for Each Gender

I then decided to create a histogram to look at how these asthma fatalities are distributed.

I'm going to use ggplot2 to make a histogram comparing the distribution of mortality rates between the two populations

```{r}
ggplot(data = asthma_mortality_no_miss, aes(x = mortality_rate, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("pink", "blue")) +
  labs(title = "Asthma Mortality Rate by Gender in the USA from 2010 to 2020", 
       x = "Mortality Rate",
       y= "Number of Observations")
```

It looks like there are some outliers, let me take a look at the data sorted by mortality rate descending

```{r}
asthma_mortality_no_miss[order(asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate, decreasing = TRUE),] 
```

Wow, it looks like in 2020 there was a huge increase due to the pandemic most likely. I'm going to take a look at the data from 2010-2019 to get a closer look at the distribution.

```{r}
asthma_mortality_drop_2020 <- asthma_mortality_no_miss %>% 
  filter(year != 2020) %>% 
  print()
```

And repeat the histogram process with the 2010 to 2019 data
```{r}
ggplot(data = asthma_mortality_drop_2020, aes(x = mortality_rate, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("pink", "blue")) +
  labs(title = "Asthma Mortality Rate by Gender in the USA from 2010 to 2019", 
       x = "Mortality Rate",
       y= "Number of Observations")
```

I want to compare the means of these populations to see if there is a statistically significant difference in fatal asthma incidence between the two genders throughout the whole USA.

### Statistical Testing

From the histogram, these don't really seem to fit a normal distribution, but rather a skewed distribution, but let's run the Shapiro-Wilk test to be sure instead of just eyeballing it and assuming.

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
shapiro.test(asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate)
```

Okay, since the p value is not greater than 0.05, I can't use a t-test as that assumes normal distribution.

I'm going to go for a non-parametric test since we're not assuming any particular distribution here to test my hypothesis that when it comes to asthma fatalities females have a higher mortality rate than males.
Since I have two unpaired samples and I want to test how their values compare, I'm going to use the Mann-Whitney test.

```{r}
wilcox.test(asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate)
```

With these results we can reject the null hypothesis, and say within this data there is a statistically significant difference between the two populations.

## Conclusion

Before this analysis I had no idea of the gender differences that arise in asthma incidents, upon looking into this further after completing this analysis I came across a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5629917/) that discusses the gender differences in asthma prevalence and severity on a biological level. 

[According to the Asthma and Allergy Network](https://allergyasthmanetwork.org/news/the-asthma-gender-gap/), In people under 18, it is more common for boys to have asthma than girls, but this prevalence switches when analyzing adult populations. The fact that women have a higher risk of death from asthma when compared to men is also confirmed by this source.
