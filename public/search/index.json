[{"content":"I found this dataset by filtering through the various settings that they have on the National Agriculture Statistics Service quick stats tool to see the condition of blueberries by year and week in the state of New Jersey.\nA lot of people think that New Jersey is only the city and the shore, but its not called the Garden State for nothing!

I also learned more about how factors work and how R automatically puts a character vector in alphabetical order, and that in order to get it to appear in the order you want on a legend, you have to change the order of the factor variable. I didn\u0026rsquo;t think about that before I started but it definitely makes sense, R doesn\u0026rsquo;t just know how humans rank the quality of blueberries.\nI also learned about geom_area(), I first tried to use geom_line() and was able to make that pretty easily, but when I tried to change it to geom_area() there was a lot that I had to change in order to get the effect that I wanted on my graph.\n","date":"2024-01-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://michelleyg1.github.io/p/jersey-blueberries/images/blueberry_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_1579336_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://michelleyg1.github.io/p/jersey-blueberries/","title":"Jersey Blueberries"},{"content":"I found this interesting dataset on Kaggle and wanted to do an exploratory analysis as I also have had asthma since I was a kid and wanted to see if I could find any interesting patterns within the data.\nLoad Packages 1 2 3 4 suppressPackageStartupMessages({ library(tidyverse) library(janitor) }) Import Dataset 1 2 3 asthma \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#34;/Users/michellegulotta/Desktop/my_first_project/asthma/CDIAsthmaByStateTransposed2010-2020.csv\u0026#34;) asthma \u0026lt;- asthma %\u0026gt;% janitor::clean_names(., \u0026#34;snake\u0026#34;) Taking a look at the first few rows of the data to see what kind of information this dataset is providing\n1 head(asthma) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 ## geo_loc year state pop_est ## 1 POINT (-86.63186076199969 32.84057112200048) 2010 Alabama 4785514 ## 2 POINT (-147.72205903599973 64.84507995700051) 2010 Alaska 713982 ## 3 POINT (-111.76381127699972 34.865970280000454) 2010 Arizona 6407342 ## 4 POINT (-92.27449074299966 34.74865012400045) 2010 Arkansas 2921998 ## 5 POINT (-120.99999953799971 37.63864012300047) 2010 California 37319550 ## 6 POINT (-106.13361092099967 38.843840757000464) 2010 Colorado 5047539 ## f_fatal m_fatal o_fatal f_er m_er o_er f_hosp m_hosp o_hosp ## 1 44 17 61 NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 2 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ## 3 31 27 58 22280 18335 40650 4717 3352 8073 ## 4 29 8 37 NA NA NA 1876 962 2841 ## 5 251 152 403 116571 96999 217637 19399 12958 34583 ## 6 33 15 48 NA NA NA 2385 1942 4336 Asthma Fatalities by Gender in New Jersey Data Visualization Clean Up Data Since its my home state, I decided to narrow the data that I wanted to look at down a bit to just New Jersey. I also only was interested in looking at fatalities for this particular graph as it is the most severe type of asthma incident recorded in this data.\nThe first thing that I needed to do was to pivot the data so that gender was its own observation, I originally missed out on this step when I was trying to make the graph and had a hard time coming up with the ggplot code as I was just repeating adding a different shape to my graph for each column.

Pick better value with `binwidth`. I want to compare the means of these populations to see if there is a statistically significant difference in fatal asthma incidence between the two genders throughout the whole USA.\nStatistical Testing From the histogram, these don\u0026rsquo;t really seem to fit a normal distribution, but rather a skewed distribution, but let\u0026rsquo;s run the Shapiro-Wilk test to be sure instead of just eyeballing it and assuming.\n1 2 options(scipen = 999) shapiro.test(asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate) 1 2 3 4 5 ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate ## W = 0.27179, p-value \u0026lt; 0.00000000000000022 Okay, since the p value is not greater than 0.05, I can\u0026rsquo;t use a t-test as that assumes normal distribution.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to go for a non-parametric test since we\u0026rsquo;re not assuming any particular distribution here to test my hypothesis that when it comes to asthma fatalities females have a higher mortality rate than males. Since I have two unpaired samples and I want to test how their values compare, I\u0026rsquo;m going to use the Mann-Whitney test.\n1 wilcox.test(asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate) 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## ## Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction ## ## data: asthma_mortality_no_miss$mortality_rate ## V = 368511, p-value \u0026lt; 0.00000000000000022 ## alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 0 With these results we can reject the null hypothesis, and say within this data there is a statistically significant difference between the two populations.\nConclusion Before this analysis I had no idea of the gender differences that arise in asthma incidents, upon looking into this further after completing this analysis I came across a paper that discusses the gender differences in asthma prevalence and severity on a biological level.\nAccording to the Asthma and Allergy Network, In people under 18, it is more common for boys to have asthma than girls, but this prevalence switches when analyzing adult populations. The fact that women have a higher risk of death from asthma when compared to men is also confirmed by this source.\n","date":"2024-01-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://michelleyg1.github.io/p/asthma-incidents-analysis/images/featured_hud7e36f7e20e71be184458283bdae4646_55974_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://michelleyg1.github.io/p/asthma-incidents-analysis/","title":"Asthma Incidents Analysis"}]
