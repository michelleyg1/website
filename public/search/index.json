I also only was interested in looking at fatalities for this particular graph as it is the most severe type of asthma incident recorded in this data.\nThe first thing that I needed to do was to pivot the data so that gender was its own observation, I originally missed out on this step when I was trying to make the graph and had a hard time coming up with the ggplot code as I was just repeating adding a different shape to my graph for each column.

The fact that women have a higher risk of death from asthma when compared to men is also confirmed by this source.\n","date":"2024-01-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://example.com/p/asthma-incidents-analysis/images/featured_hud7e36f7e20e71be184458283bdae4646_55974_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://example.com/p/asthma-incidents-analysis/","title":"Asthma Incidents Analysis"}]
